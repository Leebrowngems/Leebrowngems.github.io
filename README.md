Al James graduated with a degree in fine arts and design at the University of Santo Tomas. He became involved in hip-hop where he met his collaborators, collectively known as "Baryo Berde Atbp", there. The group now has 11 members.[1] His exposure increased with the release of "Ngayong Gabi", collecting over 25 million views in 18 months. He was praised by Highsnobiety for "his syrupy flow and purple imagery make for a chill counterpoint to the chaos of life in this dense megacity".[2] He has crossed over from underground to mainstream as his song "Ngayong Gabi" reached #1 on Wave 89.1's primetime hit in December 2017. So far,[when?] he is not signed with any record label.[3] According to an interview with FHM, one of his hip-hop contemporaries he follows is Shanti Dope. He was paid to remix his own single "Pahinga" by McDonald's for their Summer Desserts advertisement campaign entitled "Palamig Ka Muna".[4]

The three boys that make up O Side Mafia are crowded around a street food cart on the corner of their block, busy scooping steaming pares from bowls wrapped in thin plastic bags. The street is a jumble of informal houses pressed up against an aging condo skyscraper with a couple of mom-and-pop restaurants next door. It’s a part of Manila called Malate, and “O Side” is the nickname they came up with for this street. The block is tucked away at the very end of Malate’s main strip, a red-light district full of clubs and restaurants alongside Manila Bay.
